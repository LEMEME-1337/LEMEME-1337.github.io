Title:  
My first attempts at publishing using GitHub  
 Date:  
07/09/16


Starting point:
I had no knowledge
Target for this lesson?
To successfully create the infrastructure so that my Google Doc template would publish.
Did I reach my target? 
(add details to “Lesson Review”)
I think so, as I followed all the instructions and seem to have done everything in the correct order.




Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 
Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration.
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren’t relevant.  


This made me change my ways and I decided to take quick notes (on paper) so that I could remember the instructions in the correct order next time.  This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
Always be ready to make notes so that I don’t forget, and I can work better independently when things go a bit wrong...

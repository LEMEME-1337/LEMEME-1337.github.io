English translation: Hi how are you?

Russian is a very interesting language. It is a slavik language. The other 4 slavik languages are:
Ukrainian,
Polish,
Czech, and
Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian

Russian uses the cyrillic alphabet which comprimises of 33 letters. 
First Group: Written and pronounced the same. Six Russian letters are the same as English in both pronunciation and form - namely A, E, K, M, O and T.
Second Group: Look different but sound the same. Sixteen Russian letters have the same pronunciation as English ones, but are symbolized by a completely different letter. These include Б, Г, Д, ё, Ж, П, Ф, И, й, Л, Ц, Ш, Щ, Э, Ю and Я.
Third Group: Look familiar but are pronounced differently. Eight Russian letters look very similar to some English letters and numbers but they are pronounced very differently - these are В, З, Н, Р, С, У, Ч, Х.
Fourth Group: New letter and unfamiliar sound. There are some Russian letters which do not exist in English at all and either represent unfamiliar sounds or have no sound value - for example: Ы, Ъ, Ь.

Quite an interesting language.

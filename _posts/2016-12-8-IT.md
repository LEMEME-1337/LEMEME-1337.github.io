Last week, I had done many things to my blog. For example:

I had successfully added a background image (which was very nice), 
I made the container of the text slightly more opaque and rounded at the edges,
I had also added a few blogs for testing purposes but the problem is I have to write all blogs myself because docs dosn't work with my github.

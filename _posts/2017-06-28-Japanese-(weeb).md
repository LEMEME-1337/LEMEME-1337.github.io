Japanese.<br>
Weeb speak.<br>

What does it all mean?<br>

Well, Japanese is quite simple<br>
Once mastered it is more simple than English(!)<br>

1st, there are <em>no</em> pronouns. By that i mean that pronouns are omitted the majority of time. They are only used when the subject is unknown or hasnt been mentioned.<br>
私(watashi),  僕（boku), 俺（ore) - I
あなた（anata), 君（kimi) - you
我々（wareware) - we

Verbs in japanese dont conjugate to the pronouns but instead to the level of politeness and of tense. There are 2 types of verbs in Japanese, ichidan and godan. ichidan verbs end in ru(る). Some verbs that end in ru are:
<ul>
<li>
iru
aru
taberu
miru
etc
</li>
</ul>

Godan verbs are verbs that end in just u. Some verbs that end in just u are:
<ul>
<li>
nomu
iku
shinu
hanasu
desu
etc
</li>
</ul>

To conjugate ichidan verbs, you ru and put with the specific ending.
present plain - ~ru
present formal - ~masu
past plain - ~ta
past formal - ~mashita
present negative - ~nai
presnet negative formal - ~masen
present negative past - ~nakatta
present negative past formal - ~masendeshita

Some examples:

watashi wa anata o tabeta (I ate you)
watashi wa hebi tabemasu ka (May I eat the snake)
